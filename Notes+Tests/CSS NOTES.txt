CSS=CASCADING STYLE SHEETS

RULE: a block of CSS that details particular stylistic instructions to be applied to an element
SELECTOR: a part of the CSS rule taht determines which html element the rule applies to
PROPERTY: the characteristic a CSS rule is altering
VALUE: the attribute a CSS rule is applying to a specified property

BOX MODEL: padding, margin, border

this makes the whole background of the selected div red:
div.my-cascade {
background-color: red;
}

this makes only the p elements inside of the div blue:
div.my-cascade p {
background-color: blue;
}

this only selects the "ul" elements inside of the "p" elements:

div.my-cascade p ul {
font-weight: bold;
color: yellow;
}

IF TWO RULES CONFLICT, THE MOST SPECIFIC RULE WINS. 
-so the digital one is more specific and will win.

.digital p a {
font-weight: bold;
}

a {
font-weight: normal;
}

-above is called specificity.
